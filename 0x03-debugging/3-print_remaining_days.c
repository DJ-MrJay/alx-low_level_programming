/* Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

The function first checks if the given year is a leap year using the conditions (year % 4 == 0 || ((year % 100 == 0) && (year % 400 == 0))). This condition checks if the year is divisible by 4 and, if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it also checks if it's divisible by 400.

Leap years occur every 4 years: Every year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year. This is why the first part of the condition is (year % 4 == 0). For example, the year 2020 is a leap year because 2020 % 4 is equal to 0.

However, not all years divisible by 4 are leap years. There is an exception to the above rule: Century years (years ending with "00") are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400.

To handle this exception, the second part of the condition ((year % 100 == 0) && (year % 400 == 0)) is used. It checks if the year is a century year (divisible by 100) using (year % 100 == 0). For example, the year 1900 is divisible by 100 and is a century year.

If a year is a century year, it is still a leap year only if it is divisible by 400. For example, the year 2000 is a century year, but it is also divisible by 400, making it a leap year.

If the year is a leap year and the input date's month is after February (i.e., greater than 2), and the day is 60 or greater, it means we are considering a date after February 29th. Since leap years have 366 days, we increment the day by 1 to account for the extra day.

The function then proceeds to print the day of the year and the remaining days in the year, based on the input date.

If the year is not a leap year or the date is before February 29th, it will calculate the day of the year and the remaining days considering a year with 365 days.

If the date is invalid (February 30th or later), it will print an error message indicating that the date is invalid and show the correct date by subtracting 31 days from the day value.
